This is intended to be a reward paid to them to support them in continuing their journey of seeking knowledge and benefiting the nation. The role of the authorization team does not stop at carefully selecting service providers but extends to holding training courses for them to increase awareness, remind them, and renew the intention that their work is assisting their brothers and sisters in need, and that the essence is seeking what is with Allah in terms of reward and blessing, and renewing the intention while emphasizing that there is no religious harm in receiving material compensation for performing the ritual on their behalf, as the worship of Hajj or Umrah is a mixed worship (financial and physical), and the effort in it is on both fronts, and Allah knows best.",
